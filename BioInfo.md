# Biological background 

## A quick introduction to Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics 

First of all, what is *Bioinformatics*?  as you can imagine, it's what you get when you combine Biology and informatics!  
Bioinformatics includes notions of computer science, but also chemistry, physics, information science/engineering, mathematics and statistics ...  
Keep in mind that computer science and information science are two different things.  

Information science is a field primarily concerned with: Analysis, classification, manipulation, storage, retrieval, transmission and obviously information.  
It is used for *in silico* analysis of biological data obtained from *in vivo* or *in vitro* sources.
