# Biological background 
## A quick introduction to Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics 

First of all, what is *Bioinformatics*?  as you can imagine, it's what you get when you combine Biology and informatics!  
Bioinformatics includes notions of computer science, but also chemistry, physics, information science/engineering, mathematics and statistics ...  
Keep in mind that computer science and information science are two different things.  

Information science is a field primarily concerned with: Analysis, classification, manipulation, storage, retrieval, transmission and obviously information.  
It is used for *in silico* analysis of biological data obtained from *in vivo* or *in vitro* sources.

### Molecules  

**Small Molecules** &rarr; Sources of energy, Building blocks for macromolecules or signaling molecules used for signal transmission.

**Proteins** &rarr; Building blocks of the cell (and also of the organelles), functional molecules for biological processes. 
Usually they collaborate in "protein complexes" or have otherwise physical "protein-protein interactions".

### DNA and RNA  

**DNA** DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) takes care of storage and reproduction of information.  
It contains genes, regulatory elements (e.g. "transcription factor binding elements") and "junk DNA" (regions without known function)  
It has a double stranded structure (double helix)
